      <p>Welcome! I'm Andrew Lipuma, and this website is a repository/portfolio for advanced HTML and CSS. I'm currently enrolled at both CCSF and SFSU, and I'm about to graduate with a Bachelor of Music focusing on violin performance. I've done undergraduate coursework in computer science, and I really enjoy coding. I'm aiming for completing a certificate in the spirit of expanding my knowledge and skills within web development.</p>
